> **Highlights**
> - Developed and validated a novel method for high-precision identification and tracking of **fountain / stripe-like chromatin structures**.
> - Integrated reinforcement learning with **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in a continuous spatial action space**, combined with geometric transformation (**affine transformation**) to jointly optimize sampling and trajectory planning while enabling cross-sample and cross-condition comparability in an automated analysis pipeline.
> - Produced reproducible outputs including visual figures, scoring tables, and configuration snapshots, enabling large-scale screening and hypothesis testing.
> - Quantitatively characterized dynamic changes between coupled and uncoupled replication fork states under various replication stress conditions.

## Description
Replication forks in mammalian cells often progress in a **coupled** manner. Under replication stress, **type-II fountains** exhibit distinct uncoupling degrees. **Fun2** quantitatively tracks these dynamics and relates uncoupling to higher-order chromatin structures (e.g., loops), replication timing shifts, and fork-restart defects. The toolkit is intended for large-scale screening, hypothesis testing, and figure-ready output.

We have recently published the RFpeptides protocol for using RFdiffusion to design macrocyclic peptides that bind target proteins with atomic accuracy (Rettie, Juergens, Adebomi, et al., 2025). In this section we briefly outline how to run this inference protocol. We have added two examples for running macrocycle design with the RFpeptides protocol. One for monomeric design, and one for binder design.
