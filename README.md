> **Highlights**
> - Developed and validated a novel method for high-precision identification and tracking of **fountain / stripe-like chromatin structures**.
> - Integrated reinforcement learning with **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in a continuous spatial action space**, combined with geometric transformation (**affine transformation**) to jointly optimize sampling and trajectory planning while enabling cross-sample and cross-condition comparability.
> - Produced reproducible outputs including visual figures, scoring tables, and configuration snapshots, enabling large-scale screening and hypothesis testing.
> - Quantitatively characterized dynamic changes between coupled and uncoupled replication fork states under various replication stress conditions.

## Description
Replication forks in mammalian cells often progress in a **coupled** manner. Under replication stress, **type-II fountains** exhibit distinct uncoupling degrees. **Fun2** quantitatively tracks these dynamics and relates uncoupling to higher-order chromatin structures (e.g., loops), replication timing shifts, and fork-restart defects. The toolkit is intended for large-scale screening, hypothesis testing, and figure-ready output.

## Sampling Box & Axes Configuration
<img src="https://github.com/zzdzr/Fun2/blob/main/docs/image/axis.svg" alt="SamplingBox" width="500" height="500" align="left"/>

  In the contact matrix, the global coordinate system is defined by the *u*-axis and *v*-axis.  
An orientation of **0¬∞** corresponds to a direction parallel to the *v*-axis, whereas **90¬∞** is parallel to the *u*-axis.  
Sampling box orientations are specified with respect to this global axis system.  
  Each sampling box also possesses its own local geometric coordinates, denoted as the *x*-axis and *y*-axis, which define its intrinsic **length**, **width**, and **rotation angle**.  
This dual-axis definition allows explicit mapping between global matrix coordinates and the sampling box geometry.
  A complete sampling box is divided into multiple **layers** along its lengthwise extension.  
During analysis, layers sequentially capture signals as the box extends.  
  Each layer is further subdivided into a **central signal region** (purple) and two **edge regions** flanking it.  
The edge regions are used to estimate local background signal levels, analogous to edge detection techniques in image processing, thereby enhancing contrast between the feature of interest and its surrounding background.

## Affine Transformation

We have recently published the RFpeptides protocol for using RFdiffusion to design macrocyclic peptides that bind target proteins with atomic accuracy (Rettie, Juergens, Adebomi, et al., 2025). In this section we briefly outline how to run this inference protocol. We have added two examples for running macrocycle design with the RFpeptides protocol. One for monomeric design, and one for binder design.
