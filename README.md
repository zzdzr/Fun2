## Description
Chromatin is intricately folded into dynamic 3D structures, orchestrating key DNA metabolic processes. DNA replication, a core chromatin metabolic event, is tightly linked to these chromatin architectures. Recently, a replication-associated chromatin interaction structure was discovered as fountains via Replication-associated in situ Hi-C (Repli-HiC), supporting that replication forks remain spatially coupled from initiation to termination. Chromatin fountains are pivotal for understanding DNA replication within the complex chromatin landscape. However, the characteristics of these fountains can vary due to factors such as origin firing efficiency and local chromatin organization. In this study, we introduce **a reinforcement learning-based computational framework**, integrated with **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and value gradient optimization**, to develop the Fun2 algorithm. Fun2 enables a comprehensive characterization of trajectory-like chromatin architectures, including both chromatin fountains and stripes, with enhanced adaptability and accuracy. This tool facilitates systematic investigation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of DNA replication and extends to other chromatin remodeling processes, such as Cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. The Fun2 algorithm provides a versatile computational tool for deciphering dynamic chromatin architectures, offering new insights into genome organization and its regulatory mechanisms.

## Sampling Box & Axes Configuration
<img src="https://github.com/zzdzr/Fun2/blob/main/docs/image/axis.svg" alt="SamplingBox" width="500" height="500" align="left"/>

#### 1) Global axis and angle convention (contact matrix)
- The contact matrix uses a global coordinate system **(u, v)**.
- Orientation angles **Œ∏** are defined **with respect to the matrix axes**:
  - **0¬∞** ‚Üí direction **parallel to the v-axis**
  - **90¬∞** ‚Üí direction **parallel to the u-axis**
- Unless stated otherwise, angles increase counter-clockwise in the *(u, v)* frame.

#### 2) Local geometry of the sampling box
- Each sampling box has its own local coordinates **(x, y)**:
  - **y-axis**: the **extension** (lengthwise) direction of the box.
  - **x-axis**: the direction **perpendicular** to the extension (across-box).
- Geometric parameters:
  - **Length (h)**: extent along the **y**-axis.
  - **Width (w)**: extent along the **x**-axis.
  - **Rotation (Œ∏)**: box orientation expressed in the **global (u, v)** system.
- This dual-axis definition (global *(u, v)*, local *(x, y)*) permits explicit mapping between matrix coordinates and box geometry.

#### 3) Layered sampling and background estimation
- The box is partitioned into **K layers** along the **y**-axis (extension direction).
- At each layer *i*, the area is split into:
  - a **central signal region** (purple), and
  - two **edge bands** flanking it (the **edge width** is user-specified).
- The edge bands provide **local background** estimates, analogous to **edge-detection** strategies in image processing, thereby improving contrast between the trajectory signal and surrounding background.

#### 4) Notation recap
| Symbol | Meaning | Corresponding config parameter |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `(u, v)` | Global axes of the contact matrix | ‚Äî |
| `(x, y)` | Local axes of sampling box (across vs. along extension) | ‚Äî |
| `Œ∏` | Orientation angle (0¬∞ ‚à• v-axis; 90¬∞ ‚à• u-axis) | `angle` |
| `w` | Box width along **x** | `width` |
| `h` | Box height (length) along **y** | `height` |
| `K` | Number of layers along **y** | `K = h / layer_height` |
| `edge_width` | Width of background bands | `edge_width` |

## Affine Transformation
<img src="https://github.com/zzdzr/Fun2/blob/main/docs/image/affineTransform.svg" alt="Transformation" width="300" height="300" align="left"/>

In **Fun2**, an affine transformation extends the concept of a static sampling box into a **dynamic structure** capable of continuous-space transformations.  
This enables the sampling box to **trace trajectory-like patterns** in the contact matrix and quantitatively describe their properties.

Four primary forms of affine transformation are applied:

1. **Extension (`Œîh`)**  
   - Adjusts the box length (*h*, along the y-axis).  
   - **‚àíŒîh** shortens the box; **+Œîh** lengthens it, allowing coverage of varying segment lengths along the trajectory.

2. **Rotation (`ŒîŒ∏`)**  
   - Rotates the box relative to the global *(u, v)* coordinate system.  
   - **‚àíŒîŒ∏** rotates counter-clockwise; **+ŒîŒ∏** rotates clockwise.  
   - Enables alignment of the sampling box with directional patterns in the data.

3. **Expansion (`Œîw`)**  
   - Modifies the box width (*w*, along the x-axis).  
   - **‚àíŒîw** narrows the box; **+Œîw** widens it, tuning the cross-track coverage and sensitivity.

4. **Translocation (`Œîx`)**  
   - Shifts the box laterally along the x-axis without changing its orientation or dimensions.  
   - **‚àíŒîx** shifts left; **+Œîx** shifts right, enabling local repositioning while maintaining the same geometric parameters.

By combining these transformations, Fun2 performs **geometric normalization** and optimizes box placement in a continuous spatial search space‚Äîforming the basis for trajectory detection and characterization.
#### 5) Notation recap
| Symbol / Parameter | Meaning (in this section) |
|:--|:--|
| `Œîh` | Change in box length (*h*, along y-axis) |
| `ŒîŒ∏` | Change in box rotation angle (global *(u, v)* frame) |
| `Œîw` | Change in box width (*w*, along x-axis) |
| `Œîx` | Lateral shift (translocation) along x-axis |
| `action_limits` | Maximum absolute changes allowed for `[Œîw, Œîh, ŒîŒ∏, Œîx]` |
| `angle_boundary` | Angular constraints on `Œ∏` (rotation) in degrees or radians |

> **Note:** `action_limits` directly controls how much the sampling box can change per transformation step, while `angle_boundary` defines the allowable orientation range in the global coordinate system.

## Planning
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/zzdzr/Fun2/blob/main/docs/image/MCTS.svg"
       alt="MCTS planning" width="730">
</p>

Fun2 employs **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** in a **continuous spatial search space** to optimize sampling box placement and trajectory planning.  
The MCTS process iteratively explores the search space to identify high-value geometric configurations, enabling efficient detection of trajectory-like features in contact matrices.

The planning procedure follows the standard four-stage MCTS loop, repeated for *n* iterations:

1. **Selection**  
   - Starting from the root node (*s‚ÇÄ*), the algorithm selects a child node using the **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)** strategy.  
   - This balances exploration (trying new geometric configurations) and exploitation (refining known promising configurations).

2. **Expansion**  
   - A new node ($s_{t+2}$) is generated by applying a geometric transformation (affine modification) to the current sampling box state.  
   - **Progressive widening** controls the branching factor, allowing the search tree to adaptively grow in promising regions of the continuous space.

3. **Simulation**  
   - From the expanded node, a **rollout** is performed to simulate the resulting trajectory and evaluate its quality.  
   - Fun2 uses **Value Gradient Estimation** to assess the expected improvement and updates the policy (œÄ) guiding subsequent actions.

4. **Backpropagation**  
   - The results of the simulation are propagated back through the selected path in the tree.  
   - Nodes along the trajectory update their statistics, improving the accuracy of future selection steps.

By iteratively refining box placement and orientation through MCTS, Fun2 is able to:
- Search **continuous transformation parameters** (length, width, rotation, translation).
- Adaptively optimize sampling geometry for complex trajectory patterns.
- Balance global exploration with local exploitation, ensuring both novelty and accuracy in detection.

This approach integrates **reinforcement learning principles** with **geometric search**, making the sampling process dynamic, data-driven, and optimal in high-dimensional spatial contexts.
