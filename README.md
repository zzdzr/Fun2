## Description
Replication forks in mammalian cells often progress in a **coupled** manner. Under replication stress, **type-II fountains** exhibit distinct uncoupling degrees. **Fun2** quantitatively tracks these dynamics and relates uncoupling to higher-order chromatin structures (e.g., loops), replication timing shifts, and fork-restart defects. The toolkit is intended for large-scale screening, hypothesis testing, and figure-ready output.

## Sampling Box & Axes Configuration
<img src="https://github.com/zzdzr/Fun2/blob/main/docs/image/axis.svg" alt="SamplingBox" width="500" height="500" align="left"/>

#### 1) Global axis and angle convention (contact matrix)
- The contact matrix uses a global coordinate system **(u, v)**.
- Orientation angles **Œ∏** are defined **with respect to the matrix axes**:
  - **0¬∞** ‚Üí direction **parallel to the v-axis**
  - **90¬∞** ‚Üí direction **parallel to the u-axis**
- Unless stated otherwise, angles increase counter-clockwise in the *(u, v)* frame.

#### 2) Local geometry of the sampling box
- Each sampling box has its own local coordinates **(x, y)**:
  - **y-axis**: the **extension** (lengthwise) direction of the box.
  - **x-axis**: the direction **perpendicular** to the extension (across-box).
- Geometric parameters:
  - **Length (h)**: extent along the **y**-axis.
  - **Width (w)**: extent along the **x**-axis.
  - **Rotation (Œ∏)**: box orientation expressed in the **global (u, v)** system.
- This dual-axis definition (global *(u, v)*, local *(x, y)*) permits explicit mapping between matrix coordinates and box geometry.

#### 3) Layered sampling and background estimation
- The box is partitioned into **K layers** along the **y**-axis (extension direction).
- At each layer *i*, the area is split into:
  - a **central signal region** (purple), and
  - two **edge bands** flanking it (the **edge width** is user-specified).
- The edge bands provide **local background** estimates, analogous to **edge-detection** strategies in image processing, thereby improving contrast between the trajectory signal and surrounding background.

#### 4) Notation recap
| Symbol | Meaning | Corresponding config parameter |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `(u, v)` | Global axes of the contact matrix | ‚Äî |
| `(x, y)` | Local axes of sampling box (across vs. along extension) | ‚Äî |
| `Œ∏` | Orientation angle (0¬∞ ‚à• v-axis; 90¬∞ ‚à• u-axis) | `angle` |
| `w` | Box width along **x** | `width` |
| `h` | Box height (length) along **y** | `height` |
| `K` | Number of layers along **y** | `K = h / layer_height` |
| `edge_width` | Width of background bands | `edge_width` |

## Affine Transformation
<img src="https://github.com/zzdzr/Fun2/blob/main/docs/image/affineTransform.svg" alt="Transformation" width="300" height="300" align="left"/>

In **Fun2**, an affine transformation extends the concept of a static sampling box into a **dynamic structure** capable of continuous-space transformations.  
This enables the sampling box to **trace trajectory-like patterns** in the contact matrix and quantitatively describe their properties.

Four primary forms of affine transformation are applied:

1. **Extension (`Œîl`)**  
   - Adjusts the box length (*h*, along the y-axis).  
   - **‚àíŒîl** shortens the box; **+Œîl** lengthens it, allowing coverage of varying segment lengths along the trajectory.

2. **Rotation (`ŒîŒ∏`)**  
   - Rotates the box relative to the global *(u, v)* coordinate system.  
   - **‚àíŒîŒ∏** rotates counter-clockwise; **+ŒîŒ∏** rotates clockwise.  
   - Enables alignment of the sampling box with directional patterns in the data.

3. **Expansion (`Œîw`)**  
   - Modifies the box width (*w*, along the x-axis).  
   - **‚àíŒîw** narrows the box; **+Œîw** widens it, tuning the cross-track coverage and sensitivity.

4. **Translocation (`Œîx`)**  
   - Shifts the box laterally along the x-axis without changing its orientation or dimensions.  
   - **‚àíŒîx** shifts left; **+Œîx** shifts right, enabling local repositioning while maintaining the same geometric parameters.

By combining these transformations, Fun2 performs **geometric normalization** and optimizes box placement in a continuous spatial search space‚Äîforming the basis for trajectory detection and characterization.

## MCTS planning
<img src="https://github.com/zzdzr/Fun2/blob/main/docs/image/MCTS.svg" alt="Transformation" width="730" height="350"/>

Fun2 employs **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** in a **continuous spatial search space** to optimize sampling box placement and trajectory planning.  
The MCTS process iteratively explores the search space to identify high-value geometric configurations, enabling efficient detection of trajectory-like features in contact matrices.

The planning procedure follows the standard four-stage MCTS loop, repeated for *n* iterations:

1. **Selection**  
   - Starting from the root node (*s‚ÇÄ*), the algorithm selects a child node using the **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)** strategy.  
   - This balances exploration (trying new geometric configurations) and exploitation (refining known promising configurations).

2. **Expansion**  
   - A new node is generated by applying a geometric transformation (affine modification) to the current sampling box state.  
   - **Progressive widening** controls the branching factor, allowing the search tree to adaptively grow in promising regions of the continuous space.

3. **Simulation**  
   - From the expanded node, a **rollout** is performed to simulate the resulting trajectory and evaluate its quality.  
   - Fun2 uses **Value Gradient Estimation** to assess the expected improvement and updates the policy (œÄ) guiding subsequent actions.

4. **Backpropagation**  
   - The results of the simulation are propagated back through the selected path in the tree.  
   - Nodes along the trajectory update their statistics, improving the accuracy of future selection steps.

By iteratively refining box placement and orientation through MCTS, Fun2 is able to:
- Search **continuous transformation parameters** (length, width, rotation, translation).
- Adaptively optimize sampling geometry for complex trajectory patterns.
- Balance global exploration with local exploitation, ensuring both novelty and accuracy in detection.

This approach integrates **reinforcement learning principles** with **geometric search**, making the sampling process dynamic, data-driven, and optimal in high-dimensional spatial contexts.
